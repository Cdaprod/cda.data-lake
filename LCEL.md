# Overview: Building a system using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) to run agents for data processing and interaction.

# Steps:
1. Define the necessary tools using LCEL.
2. Create agent prompts and setup agent executor.
3. Implement the agent interaction logic within a Python framework.

# Classes Table:
| Class Name          | Description                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| CustomTools         | Defines custom tools for agent use.          |
| AgentSetup          | Sets up agents with prompts and executors.   |
| AgentInteraction    | Manages the interaction logic with agents.   |

# Instruction:
1. Create `CustomTools` class:
    - Define the necessary tools using the `@tool` decorator.
2. Develop `AgentSetup` class:
    - Create agent prompts using LCEL.
    - Setup the agent executor.
3. Implement `AgentInteraction` class:
    - Define the interaction logic, handling inputs and outputs from agents.

# Context:
- Ensure LangChain is properly installed and configured.
- Familiarize with LCEL to effectively define tools and agent logic.


This structure outlines a modular approach to building an agent system using LCEL within a Python framework.
