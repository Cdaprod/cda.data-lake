In the context of `cda.langchain`, a `PipelinePrompt` can be utilized to create a multi-stage processing pipeline for unstructured data. Each stage in the pipeline can be a prompt that performs a specific preprocessing task, and the final output can be structured data ready for indexing or further processing. Here's how you might integrate this concept into your router management system, using the provided documentation as a guideline:

1. **Set Up Preprocessing Templates**:
   Create individual `PromptTemplate` instances for different preprocessing stages, such as data extraction, transformation, and loading.

2. **Compose the Pipeline**:
   Use `PipelinePromptTemplate` to compose the individual templates into a coherent preprocessing pipeline.

3. **Define the Final Prompt**:
   The final prompt will be the structured data output, which can then be passed to the vector stores or made available through the API gateway.

4. **Invoke the Pipeline**:
   Once the pipeline is composed, you can pass unstructured data to it and get structured output in return.

Here's a conceptual Python code snippet demonstrating how you might compose a pipeline for data preprocessing:

```python
from langchain.prompts.pipeline import PipelinePromptTemplate
from langchain.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate

# Templates for different preprocessing stages
extraction_template = PromptTemplate.from_template("Extract relevant information: {data}")
transformation_template = PromptTemplate.from_template("Transform data into structured format: {extracted_data}")
loading_template = PromptTemplate.from_template("Load structured data into system: {transformed_data}")

# The final prompt that combines all preprocessing steps
final_template = """Preprocessing Complete:
Extracted Data: {extraction}
Transformed Data: {transformation}
Loaded Data: {loading}"""
final_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(final_template)

# Compose the pipeline with all the prompts
pipeline_prompts = [
    ("extraction", extraction_template),
    ("transformation", transformation_template),
    ("loading", loading_template)
]
pipeline_prompt = PipelinePromptTemplate(final_prompt=final_prompt, pipeline_prompts=pipeline_prompts)

# Mock data to demonstrate the pipeline
unstructured_data = {
    "data": "Unstructured text data with dates, prices, and names."
}

# Format the prompts with the unstructured data
# In a real scenario, each stage would involve actual preprocessing logic
structured_output = pipeline_prompt.format(
    data=unstructured_data["data"],
    extracted_data="Dates: [01/01/2021], Prices: [$10], Names: [John Doe]",
    transformed_data="{Date: '2021-01-01', Price: 10, Name: 'John Doe'}",
    loading="Data loaded into the vector store."
)

print(structured_output)
```

In this example, `extraction_template`, `transformation_template`, and `loading_template` are prompts corresponding to the steps of data preprocessing. The `PipelinePromptTemplate` composes these individual prompts into a pipeline that processes unstructured data through these stages, culminating in the `final_prompt`, which represents the end result of the preprocessing pipeline.

The `format` method would typically be where the actual logic of each preprocessing step is executed. The above example uses static strings for simplicity, but in practice, you would replace this with dynamic processing based on the content of the `unstructured_data`.
