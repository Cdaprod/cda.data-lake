# BIND ARG

Thank you for providing the correct information on binding runtime arguments in Langchain. Here’s a revised documentation based on the details you shared:

### Binding Runtime Arguments

In scenarios where there's a need to invoke a Runnable within a Runnable sequence with constant arguments that aren't part of the output from the preceding Runnable in the sequence or part of the user input, the `Runnable.bind()` method comes in handy for passing these arguments.

#### Example 1: Basic Binding
A simple sequence involving a prompt and model is illustrated below:

```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser
from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough

# Define the prompt template
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", "Write out the following equation using algebraic symbols then solve it. Use the format\n\nEQUATION:...\nSOLUTION:...\n\n"),
        ("human", "{equation_statement}")
    ]
)

# Define the model and runnable sequence
model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)
runnable = {"equation_statement": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | model | StrOutputParser()

# Invoke the runnable sequence
print(runnable.invoke("x raised to the third plus seven equals 12"))
```

In the code snippet above, a prompt and model sequence is defined and invoked, generating an equation and its solution based on the user's input.

#### Example 2: Binding with Stop Words
To introduce stop words when calling the model, use the `bind` method as shown below:

```python
# Modify the runnable sequence to include stop words
runnable = (
    {"equation_statement": RunnablePassthrough()} 
    | prompt 
    | model.bind(stop="SOLUTION") 
    | StrOutputParser()
)

# Invoke the modified runnable sequence
print(runnable.invoke("x raised to the third plus seven equals 12"))
```

In this example, the `bind` method is used to specify stop words, altering the output generated by the model.

#### Example 3: Attaching OpenAI Functions

Binding can also be used to attach OpenAI functions to a compatible OpenAI model. Here’s an example:

```python
# Define the functions to be attached
functions = [
    {
      "name": "solver",
      "description": "Formulates and solves an equation",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "equation": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The algebraic expression of the equation"
          },
          "solution": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The solution to the equation"
          }
        },
        "required": ["equation", "solution"]
      }
    }
  ]

# Modify the prompt, model, and runnable sequence
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", "Write out the following equation using algebraic symbols then solve it."),
        ("human", "{equation_statement}")
    ]
)
model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0).bind(function_call={"name": "solver"}, functions=functions)
runnable = (
    {"equation_statement": RunnablePassthrough()} 
    | prompt 
    | model
)

# Invoke the runnable sequence
runnable.invoke("x raised to the third plus seven equals 12")
```

In this example, the `bind` method is used to attach a solver function to a GPT-4 model, enhancing its ability to formulate and solve equations based on user input.

This detailed explanation, following the examples you provided, should provide a clear understanding of how to use the `Runnable.bind()` method in Langchain for your `main.py` project.

The `bind` method in Langchain is used to bind or attach certain arguments to a Runnable, which are not part of the output from the preceding Runnable in the sequence or part of the user input. This becomes useful when there are constant arguments needed for a particular Runnable that don't change across different invocations.

Here is a breakdown of how `bind` works and how you can use it in your code:

### Functionality of `bind`:
1. **Binding Constant Arguments**: It allows you to bind certain arguments to a Runnable. These arguments will be passed to the Runnable every time it's invoked, without needing to be provided again.
2. **Attaching OpenAI Functions**: It can be used to attach functions to a compatible OpenAI model, enhancing its capabilities.

### How to Use `bind`:
1. **Basic Usage**:
   - Syntax: `Runnable.bind(arg1=value1, arg2=value2, ...)`
   - When using `bind`, you simply call it on a Runnable object, passing the arguments you want to bind as keyword arguments.

```python
runnable = model.bind(arg1=value1, arg2=value2)
```

2. **Binding with Stop Words**:
   - If you want to specify stop words when calling a model, you can use `bind` to do this.

```python
runnable = model.bind(stop="STOP_WORD")
```

3. **Attaching OpenAI Functions**:
   - If you're using a compatible OpenAI model, you can use `bind` to attach functions to the model.

```python
functions = [...]  # Define your functions here
runnable = model.bind(function_call={"name": "function_name"}, functions=functions)
```

### Code Example:
```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough

# Define the model
model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)

# Bind constant arguments to the model
runnable = model.bind(arg1="value1", arg2="value2")

# Now, whenever you invoke `runnable`, `arg1` and `arg2` will be passed to `model` automatically.
output = runnable.invoke({"user_input": "Some input"})

# If using a compatible OpenAI model, you can attach functions using `bind` as well.
functions = [
    {
      "name": "solver",
      "description": "Formulates and solves an equation",
      ...
    }
]
runnable = model.bind(function_call={"name": "solver"}, functions=functions)
```

In this code example:
- First, a `ChatOpenAI` model is defined.
- The `bind` method is then used to attach constant arguments `arg1` and `arg2` to the model, creating a new `runnable`.
- When `runnable` is invoked, `arg1` and `arg2` are passed to `model` automatically.
- Lastly, if using a compatible OpenAI model, functions are defined and attached to the model using `bind`, which allows for enhanced functionality when `runnable` is invoked.

This method of binding arguments or attaching functions can be a powerful tool when constructing more complex Runnable sequences in Langchain, and can help ensure that the necessary data or functionality is available when and where it's needed.

In order to incorporate the `bind` method in your `master-solver`, `tokenizer`, and `object tool` within a Langchain project, you would need to have an understanding of the specific arguments and functionalities you want to bind to these tools. Here’s a hypothetical approach on how you might use `bind` with these tools:

### 1. **Master-Solver**:
Suppose your `master-solver` is a Runnable that solves complex problems and requires certain constant parameters for its operation. You could use `bind` to attach these parameters.

```python
master_solver = MasterSolver().bind(solve_method="advanced", max_iterations=1000)

# Now whenever master_solver is invoked, it will use the specified solve_method and max_iterations.
```

### 2. **Tokenizer**:
If your `tokenizer` is a Runnable that tokenizes input text and requires certain settings, you could bind these settings using `bind`.

```python
tokenizer = Tokenizer().bind(token_length=5, ignore_punctuation=True)

# Now whenever tokenizer is invoked, it will use the specified token_length and ignore_punctuation settings.
```

### 3. **Object Tool**:
Assume your `object tool` is a Runnable that manipulates or analyzes objects in a certain way and requires specific settings or parameters.

```python
object_tool = ObjectTool().bind(analysis_depth=3, include_metadata=True)

# Now whenever object_tool is invoked, it will use the specified analysis_depth and include_metadata settings.
```

### Incorporating into a Runnable sequence:
You might have a sequence where text is tokenized, then those tokens are used to solve a problem, and finally, the solution is analyzed or manipulated in some way.

```python
runnable_sequence = (input_data | tokenizer | master_solver | object_tool)
```

In this sequence, `input_data` is passed to `tokenizer`, the output of `tokenizer` is passed to `master_solver`, and the output of `master_solver` is passed to `object_tool`. Each of these Runnables has been bound with specific settings or parameters that will be used every time they are invoked within this sequence.

This way, `bind` allows you to set up your tools with the necessary configurations, making your code more modular and easier to manage.

# CONFIG

The Langchain framework has provided a neat way to configure and reconfigure your runnables on the fly, which is particularly useful when you want to experiment or allow end-users to alter the behavior of your runnables without hardcoding these configurations. Here's how you could possibly apply these configurations in your `master-solver`, `tokenizer`, and `object tool`:

### 1. **Master-Solver**:

Suppose your Master-Solver has different solving methods and parameters that you might want to tweak or let users tweak:

```python
from langchain.schema.runnable import ConfigurableField

class MasterSolver:
    # ... rest of your class

master_solver = MasterSolver().configurable_fields(
    solving_method=ConfigurableField(
        id="solving_method",
        name="Solving Method",
        description="The method to use when solving",
    ),
    max_iterations=ConfigurableField(
        id="max_iterations",
        name="Maximum Iterations",
        description="The maximum number of iterations to perform",
    )
)

# Usage:
configured_solver = master_solver.with_config(configurable={
    "solving_method": "advanced",
    "max_iterations": 1000
})
```

### 2. **Tokenizer**:

If your tokenizer has different tokenizing strategies and parameters:

```python
class Tokenizer:
    # ... rest of your class

tokenizer = Tokenizer().configurable_fields(
    strategy=ConfigurableField(
        id="strategy",
        name="Tokenizing Strategy",
        description="The strategy to use when tokenizing",
    ),
    max_tokens=ConfigurableField(
        id="max_tokens",
        name="Maximum Tokens",
        description="The maximum number of tokens to generate",
    )
)

# Usage:
configured_tokenizer = tokenizer.with_config(configurable={
    "strategy": "whitespace",
    "max_tokens": 200
})
```

### 3. **Object Tool**:

If your object tool has different analysis methods and parameters:

```python
class ObjectTool:
    # ... rest of your class

object_tool = ObjectTool().configurable_fields(
    analysis_method=ConfigurableField(
        id="analysis_method",
        name="Analysis Method",
        description="The method to use when analyzing objects",
    ),
    depth=ConfigurableField(
        id="depth",
        name="Analysis Depth",
        description="The depth of analysis to perform",
    )
)

# Usage:
configured_object_tool = object_tool.with_config(configurable={
    "analysis_method": "deep",
    "depth": 3
})
```

### Combining Them in a Chain:

```python
chain = tokenizer | master_solver | object_tool

# Configuring the chain
configured_chain = chain.with_config(configurable={
    "strategy": "whitespace",
    "solving_method": "advanced",
    "analysis_method": "deep",
    "max_tokens": 200,
    "max_iterations": 1000,
    "depth": 3
})
```

In this way, you can have a highly configurable set of tools within your Langchain project, making it easier to experiment, optimize, or expose configurations to end-users.

# INTEGRATION

Certainly, to integrate Langchain into your repositories, you can begin by understanding the core functionalities that Langchain provides. Given the provided documentation, here's a breakdown of steps you may follow:

### 1. **Running Arbitrary Functions**:
   - Create wrapper functions if your function requires multiple arguments, so that they accept a single dictionary argument.
   - Implement `RunnableLambda` to run your functions within a Langchain pipeline.

```python
from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda
from operator import itemgetter

def multiple_length_function(_dict):
    return len(_dict["text1"]) * len(_dict["text2"])

chain = {
    "a": itemgetter("foo") | RunnableLambda(length_function),
    "b": {"text1": itemgetter("foo"), "text2": itemgetter("bar")} | RunnableLambda(multiple_length_function)
} | prompt | model
```

### 2. **Accepting a Runnable Config**:
   - Utilize `RunnableConfig` to pass configuration information to nested runs within a `RunnableLambda`.

```python
from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableConfig
from langchain.callbacks import get_openai_callback

def parse_or_fix(text: str, config: RunnableConfig):
    # ... rest of your function

with get_openai_callback() as cb:
    RunnableLambda(parse_or_fix).invoke("{foo: bar}", {"tags": ["my-tag"], "callbacks": [cb]})
```

### 3. **Custom Generator Functions**:
   - Create custom generator functions that follow the signature `Iterator[Input] -> Iterator[Output]` for synchronous generators or `AsyncIterator[Input] -> AsyncIterator[Output]` for asynchronous generators.
   - Utilize these for custom output parsers or modifying outputs while preserving streaming capabilities.

```python
from typing import Iterator, List

def split_into_list(input: Iterator[str]) -> Iterator[List[str]]:
    # ... rest of your function

list_chain = str_chain | split_into_list
```

### 4. **Use RunnableParallel/RunnableMap**:
   - Employ `RunnableParallel` or `RunnableMap` to execute multiple Runnables in parallel.
   - This can be useful for manipulating the output of one Runnable to match the input format of the next Runnable in a sequence or running independent processes in parallel.

```python
from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableParallel

map_chain = RunnableParallel(joke=joke_chain, poem=poem_chain)
```

### 5. **Creating Chains**:
   - Create chains by combining different Runnables using the pipe (`|`) operator.
   - These chains can be invoked with a single argument that flows through the chain.

```python
chain1 = prompt | model

chain2 = {
    "a": itemgetter("foo") | RunnableLambda(length_function),
    "b": {"text1": itemgetter("foo"), "text2": itemgetter("bar")} | RunnableLambda(multiple_length_function)
} | prompt | model
```

### 6. **Embedding these into your repository**:
   - Structure your repository with separate modules or files for different components like prompts, models, custom functions, etc.
   - Create a main file (e.g., `main.py`) where you define and run your chains.
   - Utilize the configurations and runtime arguments to fine-tune the behavior of your chains.

Now, with these steps, you can begin integrating Langchain into your repository, structuring your code, and constructing pipelines to run your processes. Remember to adjust the configurations and customize the code snippets to match your specific use case and requirements.

Based on the elements of Langchain we've explored, integrating Langchain in your `object_tool` can bring in more structured, configurable, and parallelized execution of processes. Here's a step-by-step breakdown to integrate Langchain in your `object_tool`:

### 1. **Setting Up Langchain**:

Ensure Langchain is installed in your environment and import necessary libraries.

```python
from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda, RunnableConfig, RunnableParallel
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser
```

### 2. **Defining Functions**:

Define the functions your `object_tool` will use. If your functions accept multiple arguments, create wrappers to handle single dictionary inputs.

```python
def object_function(_dict):
    # ... your function logic
    pass

def wrapper_function(input):
    return object_function(input['arg1'], input['arg2'])
```

### 3. **Creating Runnables**:

Create `RunnableLambda` instances for your functions.

```python
runnable_function = RunnableLambda(wrapper_function)
```

### 4. **Creating Pipelines**:

Design pipelines using the `|` (pipe) operator. For instance, if you have a sequence of processes to run, you can create a pipeline as follows:

```python
pipeline = runnable_function | another_runnable_function
```

### 5. **Configurable Alternatives**:

If you have multiple ways of handling a particular step in your process, set up configurable alternatives.

```python
from langchain.schema.runnable import ConfigurableField

configurable_runnable = runnable_function.configurable_alternatives(
    ConfigurableField(id="function"),
    default_key="default",
    alternative1=alternative_runnable_function1,
    alternative2=alternative_runnable_function2
    # ... other alternatives
)
```

### 6. **Parallel Execution**:

If there are independent tasks, use `RunnableParallel` for parallel execution.

```python
parallel_chain = RunnableParallel(task1=runnable_function1, task2=runnable_function2)
```

### 7. **Handling Inputs and Outputs**:

Design your pipelines to handle inputs and outputs effectively, possibly manipulating them as necessary between steps.

```python
final_chain = input_runnable | processing_runnable | output_runnable
```

### 8. **Invoking Pipelines**:

Invoke your pipelines with the necessary inputs.

```python
result = final_chain.invoke(input_data)
```

### 9. **Testing and Debugging**:

Test your pipelines to ensure they work as expected, debugging and refining as necessary.

### 10. **Documentation and Version Control**:

Document your code thoroughly, and use version control for tracking changes and collaborative development.

By following these steps, you can integrate Langchain into your `object_tool`, structuring your code to leverage the capabilities Langchain offers for running arbitrary functions, parallel execution, and configurable alternatives among others. Adjust and extend these steps as necessary to meet the specific requirements and functionalities of your `object_tool`.

Integrating Langchain with your existing tools and libraries like `master-solution`, `tokenizer`, `check_env`, `GraphStoreSystem`, and implementing dynamic tagging and metadata extraction would likely involve a structured approach. Here's a detailed breakdown, tailored to accommodate these specific aspects:

### 1. **Setting Up Langchain**:

Ensure Langchain is installed, and import the necessary libraries, along with your existing tools:

```python
from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda, RunnableConfig, RunnableParallel
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser
import master_solution
import tokenizer
import check_env
import GraphStoreSystem
```

### 2. **Wrap Your Existing Functions**:

Wrap your existing functions from `master-solution`, `tokenizer`, `check_env`, and `GraphStoreSystem` to handle single dictionary inputs as required by Langchain.

```python
def wrapper_master_solution(input_dict):
    # ... extract arguments from input_dict and call master_solution function
    pass
    
def wrapper_tokenizer(input_dict):
    # ... similar for tokenizer
    pass
    
# ... and so on for other functions
```

### 3. **Creating Runnables**:

Create `RunnableLambda` instances for your wrapped functions.

```python
runnable_master_solution = RunnableLambda(wrapper_master_solution)
runnable_tokenizer = RunnableLambda(wrapper_tokenizer)
# ... and so on for other functions
```

### 4. **Implementing Dynamic Tagging and Metadata Extraction**:

You may need to create specific Runnables for tagging and metadata extraction. These runnables would process data, extract metadata, and add tags dynamically.

```python
def dynamic_tagging(input_dict):
    # ... your logic for tagging
    pass
    
def metadata_extraction(input_dict):
    # ... your logic for metadata extraction
    pass
    
runnable_tagging = RunnableLambda(dynamic_tagging)
runnable_metadata = RunnableLambda(metadata_extraction)
```

### 5. **Creating Pipelines**:

Design pipelines using the `|` (pipe) operator, orchestrating the sequence in which your functions should be executed.

```python
pipeline = runnable_check_env | runnable_master_solution | runnable_tokenizer | runnable_tagging | runnable_metadata | runnable_GraphStoreSystem
```

### 6. **Parallel Execution**:

If there are independent tasks, use `RunnableParallel` for parallel execution.

```python
parallel_chain = RunnableParallel(task1=runnable_tokenizer, task2=runnable_metadata)
```

### 7. **Handling Inputs and Outputs**:

Ensure your pipelines handle inputs and outputs effectively, manipulating them as necessary between steps.

```python
final_chain = input_runnable | processing_runnable | output_runnable
```

### 8. **Invoking Pipelines**:

Invoke your pipelines with the necessary inputs.

```python
result = final_chain.invoke(input)

# PIPELINES, FUNCTIONS, and FALLBACKS


The provided code snippets and explanations showcase various functionalities provided by Langchain for building pipelines, handling errors, and implementing fallbacks. To better improve or optimize this setup, there are several steps and methodologies that can be employed. Let’s break it down:

### 1. **Error Handling and Fallbacks**:
   
The code exhibits a method to handle API errors by defining fallbacks which is a robust approach. However, it's essential to have extensive logging to monitor and debug these fallback occurrences. 

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def log_error(fallback_chain):
    def wrapper(input):
        try:
            return fallback_chain(input)
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Error occurred: {e}")
            raise  # re-raise the exception after logging it
    return wrapper

# Usage:
llm = openai_llm.with_fallbacks([log_error(anthropic_llm)])
```

### 2. **Custom Error Classes**:
   
Creating custom error classes can help in better understanding and handling of different error scenarios.

```python
class CustomRateLimitError(RateLimitError):
    pass

# Now, we can have more control over how to handle this specific error.
```

### 3. **Optimizing Fallback Sequences**:
   
In the case of multiple fallbacks, ensuring the most likely to succeed or least resource-intensive fallbacks are tried first can save resources.

```python
llm = openai_llm.with_fallbacks([anthropic_llm, another_llm])  # Arrange by likelihood or resource intensity
```

### 4. **Test Coverage**:
   
Ensuring extensive test coverage for different scenarios including error cases, fallback cases, and normal cases to validate the behavior of the pipeline.

```python
def test_pipeline():
    # Mocking, setup...
    # ...
    assert chain.invoke({"animal": "kangaroo"}) == expected_output
    # ...

# Ensure tests cover a variety of scenarios and edge cases.
```

### 5. **Modular Design**:
   
Keeping the pipeline design modular and well-organized can help in managing and extending the code. This includes separating different logical parts into different functions or even different modules/files.

### 6. **Custom Parser and Transformer Functions**:
   
The implementations of custom parser and transformer functions like `split_into_list` and `multiple_length_function` are good. However, ensuring that these functions have good error handling and logging will make debugging easier.

```python
def multiple_length_function(_dict):
    try:
        return _multiple_length_function(_dict["text1"], _dict["text2"])
    except KeyError as e:
        logging.error(f"Missing expected key: {e}")
        raise
```

### 7. **Performance Monitoring**:
   
Implementing performance monitoring to track the execution time, memory usage, and other performance metrics for different parts of the pipeline can provide insights for optimization.

```python
import time

def performance_monitor(chain):
    def wrapper(input):
        start_time = time.time()
        output = chain(input)
        end_time = time.time()
        logging.info(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
        return output
    return wrapper

# Usage:
optimized_chain = performance_monitor(chain)
```

### 8. **Documentation and Comments**:
   
Ensure that the code is well-documented and commented to help developers understand the logic and the data flow in the pipelines.

### 9. **Concurrency and Parallelism**:

In scenarios where tasks can be executed in parallel, utilizing concurrency frameworks can improve performance. The example provided already leverages `RunnableParallel` which is a step in the right direction.

```python
map_chain = RunnableParallel(joke=joke_chain, poem=poem_chain)
```

### 10. **Code Review and Refactoring**:
   
Regular code reviews and refactoring sessions can help in identifying potential issues, optimizing the code, and ensuring that best practices are followed.

This structured approach aims at enhancing the robustness, maintainability, and performance of the pipeline setup within Langchain.

        raise
```

```python
import time

def performance_monitor(chain):
    def wrapper(input):
        start_time = time.time()
        output = chain(input)
        end_time = time.time()
        logging.info(f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
        return output
    return wrapper

Regular code reviews and refactoring sessions can help in identifying potential issues, optimizing the code, and ensuring that best practices are followed.

This structured approach aims at enhancing the robustness, maintainability, and performance of the pipeline setup within Langchain.


Creating a custom pipeline and wrapper modules requires a clear understanding of the functional and non-functional requirements, as well as the architecture of your existing system. Based on the information you've provided and the Langchain code snippets, I'll provide a simplified example of how these modules might look. 

### pipeline.py:
This file will contain the definition of your custom pipeline.

```python
from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda, RunnableConfig, RunnableParallel
from langchain.schema.output_parser import StrOutputParser
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from operator import itemgetter
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

class CustomPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = ChatOpenAI()
        self.prompt = None  # Define your prompt template here

    def create_pipeline(self):
        prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("...")  # Define your template
        chain = prompt_template | self.model | StrOutputParser()
        return chain

    def invoke(self, input_data):
        chain = self.create_pipeline()
        try:
            return chain.invoke(input_data)
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Pipeline invocation failed: {e}")
            raise

# Usage:
# custom_pipeline = CustomPipeline()
# result = custom_pipeline.invoke({"animal": "bear"})
```

### runnablewrappers.py:
This file will contain custom runnable wrappers that you might use to extend functionality or handle special processing.

```python
from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda
from operator import itemgetter
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

class RunnableWrapper:
    def __init__(self, runnable):
        self.runnable = runnable

    def __call__(self, input_data):
        try:
            return self.runnable(input_data)
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"RunnableWrapper invocation failed: {e}")
            raise

def length_function(text):
    return len(text)

def multiple_length_function(_dict):
    text1, text2 = _dict["text1"], _dict["text2"]
    return len(text1) * len(text2)

# Runnable Lambdas
length_lambda = RunnableLambda(length_function)
multiple_length_lambda = RunnableLambda(multiple_length_function)

# Usage:
# wrapped_length_lambda = RunnableWrapper(length_lambda)
# result = wrapped_length_lambda({"text": "example"})
```

In this simplified example, `CustomPipeline` class in `pipeline.py` encapsulates the creation and invocation of a Langchain pipeline. The `RunnableWrapper` class in `runnablewrappers.py` provides a way to wrap a `RunnableLambda` or other runnable objects, enabling additional error handling or other functionality.

Ensure to tailor these examples to fit your code base's unique structure, requirements, and coding conventions. The actual implementation may be more complex, depending on the interactions between your custom object preprocessor, mapping functionalities, and the Langchain library.
