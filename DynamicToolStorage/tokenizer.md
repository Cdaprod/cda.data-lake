I was able to find a variety of tokenizers from Hugging Face's Transformers library that could be utilized for different purposes, including general text processing, code processing, and multi-lingual tokenization. However, not all of them may be directly suited for semantic understanding of code. 

1. **General Text Processing**:
   - **BertTokenizer**: Utilized in the BERT model, known for handling a wide variety of text processing tasks【12†source】.
   - **GPT2Tokenizer**: Used in GPT-2 model, capable of handling various text processing tasks【13†source】.
   - **RobertaTokenizer**: A variant of GPT-2 tokenizer used in the RoBERTa model, which is optimized for more robust performance on a variety of NLP tasks【14†source】.

2. **Code Processing**:
   - **CodeBertTokenizer**: A tokenizer from the CodeBERT model, which is designed for processing code. It's capable of handling multiple programming languages【18†source】.

3. **Multi-lingual Processing**:
   - **MBartTokenizer**: Supports tokenization of text in multiple languages, and it can handle a variety of text processing tasks【15†source】.

For semantic understanding of code, it's logical to consider **CodeBertTokenizer** due to its design for code processing. However, the semantic understanding may need to be enhanced with additional models or methods, possibly in combination with Langchain's capabilities.

For implementing these tokenizers within a preprocessing class for Langchain, you could define a class `PreprocessingRunnerBranch` that houses multiple `Runnable` instances, each wrapping one of the tokenizers mentioned. You may also need to define custom tokenization functions if the provided tokenizers don't meet your requirements exactly.

Here's a simplified example:

```python
from langchain.schema.runnable import Runnable
from transformers import BertTokenizer, GPT2Tokenizer, RobertaTokenizer, CodeBertTokenizer, MBartTokenizer

class TokenizerRunnable(Runnable):
    def __init__(self, tokenizer):
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer
    
    def run(self, text):
        return self.tokenizer.encode(text)

class PreprocessingRunnerBranch:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tokenizers = {
            'bert': TokenizerRunnable(BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')),
            'gpt2': TokenizerRunnable(GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')),
            'roberta': TokenizerRunnable(RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained('roberta-base')),
            'codebert': TokenizerRunnable(CodeBertTokenizer.from_pretrained('codebert-base')),
            'mbart': TokenizerRunnable(MBartTokenizer.from_pretrained('facebook/mbart-large-cc25'))
        }
    
    def tokenize(self, text, tokenizer_key):
        tokenizer_runnable = self.tokenizers.get(tokenizer_key)
        if tokenizer_runnable:
            return tokenizer_runnable.run(text)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown tokenizer key: {tokenizer_key}")

# Usage:
preprocessing_runner_branch = PreprocessingRunnerBranch()
tokenized_text = preprocessing_runner_branch.tokenize("some text or code", 'bert')  # Example usage with BERT tokenizer
```

In this example:
- A `TokenizerRunnable` class is defined that wraps a tokenizer instance and implements the `run` method required by Langchain's `Runnable` interface.
- A `PreprocessingRunnerBranch` class is defined that houses multiple `TokenizerRunnable` instances, each wrapping a different tokenizer from the Transformers library.
- The `tokenize` method of `PreprocessingRunnerBranch` allows you to specify which tokenizer to use by providing a key that corresponds to one of the housed `TokenizerRunnable` instances.

This setup allows you to easily switch between different tokenizers for preprocessing, depending on the text or code you are working with.
