If you're using the `os` module and `load_dotenv` from the `python-dotenv` package for handling environment variables, you can include their usage in the deployment scripts. This approach is useful for managing sensitive configurations like API keys, database URIs, etc., in a secure manner. Here's how you can incorporate them into your deployment scripts.

### Including `os` and `load_dotenv` in Deployment Scripts

#### 1. Configuration Engine with Environment Variables

```python
%%writefile configuration_engine.py
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

class ConfigurationEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        load_dotenv()  # Load environment variables from .env file
        # Load other configurations here

    def get_config(self, config_name):
        # Use os.environ to get environment variables
        # Return the requested configuration
        pass
```

#### 2. MinIO Client Configuration with Environment Variables

```python
%%writefile minio_client_config.py
import os
from minio import Minio
from dotenv import load_dotenv

class MinioClientConfig:
    def __init__(self):
        load_dotenv()
        self.endpoint = os.getenv('MINIO_ENDPOINT')
        self.access_key = os.getenv('MINIO_ACCESS_KEY')
        self.secret_key = os.getenv('MINIO_SECRET_KEY')
        self.secure = os.getenv('MINIO_SECURE', 'true').lower() == 'true'

    def get_client(self):
        return Minio(
            self.endpoint,
            access_key=self.access_key,
            secret_key=self.secret_key,
            secure=self.secure
        )
```

#### 3. Backend Deployment Script with Environment Variables

```python
%%writefile deploy_backend.py
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

def deploy_backend():
    load_dotenv()
    # Use os.environ to access environment variables
    backend_url = os.getenv('BACKEND_URL')
    print(f"Deploying backend to {backend_url}...")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    deploy_backend()
```

#### 4. API Deployment Script with Environment Variables

```python
%%writefile deploy_api.py
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

def deploy_api():
    load_dotenv()
    # Use os.environ to access environment variables
    api_url = os.getenv('API_URL')
    print(f"Deploying API to {api_url}...")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    deploy_api()
```

#### 5. Frontend Deployment Script with Environment Variables

```python
%%writefile deploy_frontend.py
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

def deploy_frontend():
    load_dotenv()
    # Use os.environ to access environment variables
    frontend_url = os.getenv('FRONTEND_URL')
    print(f"Deploying frontend to {frontend_url}...")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    deploy_frontend()
```

### Conclusion

Using `os` and `load_dotenv` in your deployment scripts allows you to securely manage configurations and sensitive data. Ensure that your `.env` files are never committed to version control for security reasons. These scripts now load environment variables from `.env` files, providing a flexible and secure way to manage configurations for different environments (development, staging, production, etc.).

Let's outline the content for `INTEGRATE_MICROSERVICE_NOTEBOOK.ipynb`, which will describe the process of integrating a new microservice into your existing data lake infrastructure. This notebook will include instructions and code snippets for setting up the microservice, integrating it with other services like MinIO, and deploying it using your CI/CD pipeline.

This notebook structure provides a guided, step-by-step approach to integrating new microservices into your data lake infrastructure, ensuring consistency and reliability in the process.

---

Based on our previous discussions and the creation of the `INTEGRATE_MICROSERVICE_NOTEBOOK.ipynb`, the `RUN_DEPLOYMENT_NOTEBOOK.ipynb` may need to be updated or rewritten if it's meant to incorporate the integration of new microservices as a regular part of your deployment process. The updated notebook would include steps for deploying your existing infrastructure and also for integrating any new microservices that have been developed.

Here's an outline of how `RUN_DEPLOYMENT_NOTEBOOK.ipynb` might look after updating:

### `RUN_DEPLOYMENT_NOTEBOOK.ipynb`

#### 1. Introduction Cell

```python
%%writefile run_deployment_notebook_01_introduction.py
print("Data Lake and Microservice Deployment Notebook")
print("This notebook covers the deployment of the data lake infrastructure and the integration of new microservices.")
```

#### 2. Deploy Data Lake Infrastructure

This section includes cells for setting up and deploying the primary components of your data lake. It will mirror the original deployment notebook's content, focusing on initializing MinIO, setting up the backend, API, and frontend, and ensuring that all these components are properly configured and running.

```python
%%writefile run_deployment_notebook_02_deploy_data_lake.py
# Add your existing deployment code here
```

#### 3. Integrate New Microservices

This section will contain instructions and scripts for integrating new microservices into your existing infrastructure. It should include steps for configuration, testing, and deployment, similar to the `INTEGRATE_MICROSERVICE_NOTEBOOK.ipynb`.

```python
%%writefile run_deployment_notebook_03_integrate_microservices.py
# Add code for integrating new microservices
```

#### 4. CI/CD Pipeline Checks

Include steps for verifying the successful execution of your CI/CD pipelines, ensuring that both the data lake components and the newly integrated microservices are deployed correctly.

```python
%%writefile run_deployment_notebook_04_cicd_checks.py
print("Ensure to check the CI/CD pipeline for the deployment status of both data lake components and new microservices.")
```

#### 5. Monitoring and Validation

This section should focus on the monitoring of the deployed components and the validation of the entire deployment, ensuring everything is functioning as expected.

```python
%%writefile run_deployment_notebook_05_monitoring_validation.py
# Code for monitoring and validating the deployment
```

#### 6. Conclusion

Conclude the notebook with any final steps or reminders for the maintenance and monitoring of the system.

```python
%%writefile run_deployment_notebook_06_conclusion.py
print("Deployment and integration processes are now complete.")
print("Monitor the system for performance and functionality. Regularly check for updates and improvements.")
```

### Using the Notebook

- **Run Each Cell**: Execute each cell sequentially to perform the steps outlined in the notebook.
- **Monitor Outputs**: Keep an eye on the outputs of each cell for any errors or important information.
- **Regular Updates**: Update the notebook as needed when new components or microservices are added to your infrastructure.

This updated `RUN_DEPLOYMENT_NOTEBOOK.ipynb` provides a comprehensive guide for deploying your data lake infrastructure and integrating new microservices, ensuring a smooth and efficient workflow.
