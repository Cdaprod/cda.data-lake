This process involves fetching data from a Minio bucket, structuring it appropriately, and then ingesting it into Weaviate as data objects corresponding to a specific class. Here's a structured approach to achieving this:

### Overview:
Implement a workflow where the Minio tool fetches all objects from a specified Minio bucket, processes and structures the data, which is then ingested into Weaviate by the Weaviate tool, with the Minio bucket name mapping to a Weaviate class name.

### Steps:

1. **Minio Tool Implementation:**
   - Create a Python class for the Minio tool to interact with the Minio service and fetch all objects from a specified bucket.
   - Parse the fetched data into structured objects.

```python
from minio import Minio

class MinioTool:
    def __init__(self, minio_client: Minio):
        self.minio_client = minio_client

    def get_objects(self, bucket_name):
        objects = self.minio_client.list_objects(bucket_name)
        structured_objects = [self.parse_object(obj) for obj in objects]
        return structured_objects

    def parse_object(self, obj):
        # Logic to parse Minio object into a structured object
        ...
```

2. **Weaviate Tool Implementation:**
   - Create a Python class for the Weaviate tool to interact with the Weaviate service and ingest structured objects.
   - Implement a method to ingest structured objects as data objects in Weaviate under a specified class.

```python
import weaviate

class WeaviateTool:
    def __init__(self, weaviate_client: weaviate.Client):
        self.weaviate_client = weaviate_client

    def ingest_objects(self, class_name, structured_objects):
        for obj in structured_objects:
            self.weaviate_client.class_(class_name).create(obj)
```

3. **ReAct Agent Workflow:**
   - Create a ReAct agent to orchestrate the workflow between the Minio tool and the Weaviate tool.
   - Implement a method to execute the entire workflow: fetch objects from Minio, structure the data, and ingest it into Weaviate.

```python
class DataIngestionAgent:
    def __init__(self, minio_tool: MinioTool, weaviate_tool: WeaviateTool):
        self.minio_tool = minio_tool
        self.weaviate_tool = weaviate_tool

    def ingest_data(self, bucket_name):
        structured_objects = self.minio_tool.get_objects(bucket_name)
        class_name = bucket_name  # Assuming bucket_name maps directly to class_name in Weaviate
        self.weaviate_tool.ingest_objects(class_name, structured_objects)
```

### Classes Table:

| Class Name        | Description                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| MinioTool         | Tool class for interacting with Minio           |
| WeaviateTool      | Tool class for interacting with Weaviate        |
| DataIngestionAgent| ReAct agent for orchestrating the data ingestion workflow |

### Instruction:

1. Implement the `MinioTool` class with methods to interact with the Minio service and parse the fetched data into structured objects.
2. Implement the `WeaviateTool` class with methods to interact with the Weaviate service and ingest structured objects.
3. Implement the `DataIngestionAgent` ReAct agent class to orchestrate the workflow between the Minio and Weaviate tools, fetching data from Minio, structuring it, and ingesting it into Weaviate.

### Context:

- Ensure that the `Minio` and `Weaviate` client objects are properly authenticated and configured to interact with the respective services.
- The parsing logic in the `parse_object` method of the `MinioTool` class should be designed based on the data format in Minio and the data structure requirements for Weaviate ingestion.
- Ensure error handling is implemented to manage potential issues that may arise during the data fetching, parsing, and ingestion process.

This structured approach provides a basis for implementing a system to ingest data from Minio into Weaviate using a ReAct agent to orchestrate the workflow.
